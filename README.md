Application for checking the strength of the password.

## Comments:

- Good password verification can be achieved using a library (not possible through regex). For real-world application it's better to allow user to enter any alphabet letters from Unicode charset. However, for the test task it will be overkill.
- I allowed users to enter even emojis as special characters, which not only avoids restrictions but also enhances password security for the user.
