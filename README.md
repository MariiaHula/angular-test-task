# Greetings, dear USENSE Company :wave:

## Test task: Program for checking the reliability of the password.

### Comment to the completion:

- Fully verifying a password can be achieved using a library (not possible through regex). However, for this task, it's an additional dependency that might not be necessary, in my opinion. Yet, I understand that this isn't sufficient for the complete utilization of Unicode characters.

- The downsides also include the fact that a wide range of characters gives users more chances to forget their passwords.

- The advantages of this implementation lie in the ability to even use emojis for passwords, which not only avoids restrictions but also enhances password security for the user.
